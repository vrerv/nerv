## Overview

In this tutorial, we will install the necessary tools and run a simple openai-cookbook notebook to learn how to use the openai API.

### Preparation

* To use the OpenAI API, get an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI site](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
  You need to create an account and enter your credit card information.
* Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the OS environment variable. To add it in Windows OS, go to windows menu > Settings > System > About > "Advanced System Settings" popup, click Environment Variables button,
  Click the add button on System Variables, enter `OPENAI_API_KEY` as the variable name and your API key as the variable value.

## Using Jupyter Notebook on PC

### Preparation

* `JupyterLab` is the next generation web-based interactive development environment that replaces `Jupyter Notebook`.
* `Miniconda` - a minimalized version of a package manager that allows you to manage virtual environments and install packages in `Python` (other languages besides `Python`?!)

### Miniconda

Commands for creating virtual environments when using `Miniconda`, allowing you to run multiple versions of `Python` in separate environments by creating different environments.

* `conda create -n "virtual-env-name" python=3.8` - creates a virtual environment with a specific name with a specific version of `Python`.
* `conda info -e` - get a list of virtual environments
* `conda activate "virtual-env-name"` - activates the virtual environment with the specified name
* `conda deactivate` - deactivates(exit) a virtual environment
* `conda remove -n "virtual-env-name" --all` - remove a virtual environment with the specified name

### INstalling and running JupyterLab

Here is the installation sequence

1. install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (include `Python` in the installation file)
  * On Windows, after completing the installation with the installation file, "Anaconda Powershell Prompt (miniconda3)" is created in the menu. Press it to run it.
  * Check if the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set correctly with the command `echo $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. `conda create -n openai python=3.8` - Create a virtual environment with the name "openai" in python 3.8 version.
3. `conda activate openai` - Activate the virtual environment created
4. `pip install jupyterlab` - Install JupyterLab
5. `pip install tenacity tiktoken openai "openai[datalib]"` - Install the OpenAI API related libraries
6. `jupyter lab .` - Run `JupyterLab` with the current directory (`.`) as the root of the notebook, and automatically open the browser to display the `JupyterLab` webpage.

### Explore the OpenAI API Cookbook

* [OpenAI API Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)

Run `JupyterLab` locally by `cloning` with `git`.

Find the `examples/Embedding_long_inputs.ipynb` notebook and run it.
